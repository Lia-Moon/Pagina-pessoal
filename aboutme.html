				<p>My name is Julia, I'm 25 years old, and I work as an administrative assistant with great aspirations in the programming field. I'm currently studying Software Engineering and I have a degree in Law, which provides me with a comprehensive and critical view of the world.</p>
				<p>Although I don't have professional experience in the IT field, I have relevant skills such as knowledge of HTML and CSS for website creation, programming logic, and basic understanding of JavaScript, C, and Python.</p>
				<p>During my free time, I enjoy reading and playing computer games. I live in the interior of São Paulo and had the opportunity to study abroad in Canada for one year, where I attended the third year of high school (grade 12).</p>
				<p>I've already created my own personal website as my first project and have also been involved in other smaller projects during the courses I took at a platform called Alura.</p>
				<p>My professional goals include career growth and the opportunity to contribute to real projects in the IT field. With my academic background and passion for technology, I believe I have the potential to become an excellent IT professional and achieve great accomplishments throughout my career.</p>
